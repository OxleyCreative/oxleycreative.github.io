        Re-Imagining the Checkout Experience

          <p>
            The checkout is one of the most pivotal pieces to a user&rsquo;s buying experience. We wanted to make sure that ours wasn&rsquo;t causing users undue stress or confusion. Since the checkout process could take the user through numerous different pathways depending on what they chose, we had to carefully consider where we asked users for information and how we presented their options. From shipping to their own address, shipping to an installer and scheduling an appointment, or coming in to pick-up their order themselves, we had to make sure that all the options were clearly presented and explained.

        Buying Tires Isn&rsquo;t Always Easy, But Maybe It Can Be Easier
        </h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            When we talk to consumers about the tire buying experience we often hear words like, &ldquo;scary,&rdquo; &ldquo;confusing,&rdquo; &ldquo;overwhelming,&rdquo; and &ldquo;expensive.&rdquo; So we have developed tools to help users deal with these negative feelings by providing a purchasing experience that leads them through the process. We try to give them all the information they need to make an informed decision and provide them with ways to make sense of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two key features to accomplishing this are our Tire Decision Guide and Compare Bar. These allow users to compare products side-by-side and see what&rsquo;s recommended and why. It helps narrow down selections based on the criteria they are interested in, whether that&rsquo;s price, performance, or anything else.

        Finding the Wheel That Looks Right For You

          <p>
            Sometimes it&rsquo;s about the numbers. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just about the looks. We have found that when users are looking for wheels, there&rsquo;s usually only one question on their minds. &ldquo;How does it look on my car?&rdquo; To answer that question we have a feature called the Wheel Visualizer. By harnessing our catalog of vehicle and product photography, it allows us to give users a pretty good idea of how a wheel will match their ride.
