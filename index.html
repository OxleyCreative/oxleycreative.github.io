        Re-Imagining the Checkout Experience
		    </h3>

          <p>
            The checkout is one of the most pivotal pieces to a user&rsquo;s buying experience. We wanted to make sure that ours wasn&rsquo;t causing users undue stress or confusion. Since the checkout process could take the user through numerous different pathways depending on what they chose, we had to carefully consider where we asked users for information and how we presented their options. From shipping to their own address, shipping to an installer and scheduling an appointment, or coming in to pick-up their order themselves, we had to make sure that all the options were clearly presented and explained.

        Buying Tires Isn't Always Easy, But Maybe It Can Be Easier

            Email brings with it very unique and interesting challenges. Not only is there the importance of tailoring content which will fit and be relevant to each recipient, but also the content must be designed in a way that it looks good and engages users across the entire spectrum of email clients. While not easy, this provides the opportunity to come up with creative solutions that suit both the users interests as well as their technological requirements no matter if they are viewing on desktop or mobile.
          </p>

            Whether it is a wholesale newsletter or a retail Father&rsquo;s Day email, each campaign must appeal to a different audience. With the recent retail site redesign, every retail email campaign has been redesigned to better fit the needs of the users. Dynamic content which accommodates the interests and past selections of the users has been reimagined along with a fresh new look to bring life to each campaign.

            Part of being successful is letting people know all the great things that are available. There are always new promotional campaigns and incentive programs running for both retail and wholesale customers. Alongside that, there are also advertisements running to inform users of the different features and content offered on the site. Each of these advertising campaigns requires careful thought and planning to reach its audience. The promotional campaigns also require combining Tire Rack branding with manufacturing partners&rsquo; branding in a way that compliments both.
