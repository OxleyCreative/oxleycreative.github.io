        Buying Tires Isn&rsquo;t Always Easy, But Maybe It Can Be Easier
		    </h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            When we talk to consumers about the tire buying experience we often hear words like, &ldquo;scary,&rdquo; &ldquo;confusing,&rdquo; &ldquo;overwhelming,&rdquo; and &ldquo;expensive.&rdquo; So we have developed tools to help users deal with these negative feelings by providing a purchasing experience that leads them through the process. We try to give them all the information they need to make an informed decision and provide them with ways to make sense of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two key features to accomplishing this are our Tire Decision Guide and Compare Bar. These allow users to compare products side-by-side and see what&rsquo;s recommended and why. It helps narrow down selections based on the criteria they are interested in, whether that&rsquo;s price, performance, or anything else.

            One of the first things we needed to do was map out the current checkout process. Buying tires can be a complicated and confusing process to users and we knew that if we asked for too much information too quickly it could be overwhelming. So we tried to streamline the process as much as possible while restructuring where we asked for some information.

            After reviewing, one of our findings was how front-loaded our information and decision making for the user could feel. In some scenarios there could be multiple modals that would require them to enter information or make a decision before even proceeding from the cart to the rest of the checkout. Then once they were able to proceed they were hitting a page that made them decide between logging in or proceeding as a guest. We were seeing a large bounce rate here so we dug in further.

            User testing indicated that most users weren&rsquo;t even expecting to hit a login screen at this point in the process. We also learned that many people weren&rsquo;t seeing the guest checkout option. There were a couple other factors we thought might be contributing as well. An average consumer will only purchase tires once every few years. This meant that many users weren&rsquo;t able to remember their passwords, or if they even had an account at all. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We thought of a couple ways to remedy this that we could test. First was creating a login page which featured the guest checkout more prominently so that users wouldn&rsquo;t miss it as easily. Second was the addition of third party login options so that users would be less likely to be frustrated by forgotten passwords or account information.

          <p>
            The other approach we formulated was skipping the login page entirely and making checkout as guest the default path. This allowed the user to proceed unimpeded. The downside of this approach is obviously that the user then might have an account that they aren&rsquo;t leveraging. To help alleviate this we decided to add a login reminder banner that would allow the user to quickly and easily log in at any point and harness any information they already had entered in their account.

            Another thing we found that users had difficulty with was just not knowing what to expect from the checkout process in general. They didn&rsquo;t have clear ideas as to the length, what information they would be asked for, or decisions they would be asked to make in some cases. To counteract some of these feelings we developed a feature we dubbed the “step header.” The first goal was to help orient the user within the process and give them a general idea of how much further they had to go. The second goal was to give users a way to easily review the decisions they had made and information they had entered. The third goal was to give users a way to quickly return to and edit any of those decisions and information. The feature met these goals through an interactive progress bar that gives the user a general idea of progression as well as some sense of how long the overall process is. It also included a slide-out that allowed users to review a summary of information entered throughout the checkout.

            To combat the issue of front loading what we were asking from the users, we eliminated the information gathering modals that could pop-up when trying to proceed from the cart. We moved those questions and added them as sub-steps to our main information-gathering page. This also helped with setting user expectations and allowed them to feel more confident in the process.

            Overall, the checkout process was redesigned front-to-back. Every aspect was considered and analysized with decisions from small to large being discussed and made on every page. Please explore the prototypes below to see some of the work that went into rebuilding the checkout.
