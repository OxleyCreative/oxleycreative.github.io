        Buying Tires Isn&rsquo;t Always Easy, But Maybe It Can Be Easier
		    </h1>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            When we talk to consumers about the tire buying experience we often hear words like, &ldquo;scary,&rdquo; &ldquo;confusing,&rdquo; &ldquo;overwhelming,&rdquo; and &ldquo;expensive.&rdquo; So we have developed tools to help users deal with these negative feelings by providing a purchasing experience that leads them through the process. We try to give them all the information they need to make an informed decision and provide them with ways to make sense of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two key features to accomplishing this are our Tire Decision Guide and Compare Bar. These allow users to compare products side-by-side and see what&rsquo;s recommended and why. It helps narrow down selections based on the criteria they are interested in, whether that&rsquo;s price, performance, or anything else.

            The Tire Decision Guide starts off by asking users a series of questions such as what vehicle they drive, the conditions they drive in, and other general information. Then it asks the user to rate their priorities from one to five including price, wet performance, dry performance, etc. We use this information to generate up to three tire recommendations based on the user's answers. One of the key portions of the design is the recommendations bar at the top of the page which shows the user which attributes were used to select the recommendations. We found it helps give the user confidence that they are getting something they want. If the user were to edit their priorities they would be able to see the recommendations switch. It also includes a link to log in and save the results. That way, even if they don&rsquo;t purchase something right away, they can always reference it later.

          <p>
            When it comes to comparing information, it&rsquo;s hard to beat a table. We had to take some considerations for accessibility and mobile screen sizes when implementing, but we wanted users to be able to quickly cross reference all the different aspects of the tires. We noticed too that it can be easy to forget which column pertains to which tire. To counteract this we implemented sliding headers to help the user stay oriented throughout their comparison, and also allow them easy access to the &ldquo;add to cart&rdquo; button whenever they were ready to purchase.

            Another facet of the design we took into consideration was the order of the information. User testing has shown that reviews and performance testing are two of the most crucial pieces of information to a purchase. So we kept that info to the top of the page and very easily accessible. We added an expanded view so users could get the fine details on each performance category.

            We also found that some users wanted that ability to compare tires side-by-side, but they didn&rsquo;t need us to give them any recommendations. To accomplish this, while building on to what we had established with the Tire Decision Guide, we implemented what we called the Compare Bar on our product search pages. This allowed users to select any products they wanted from the search page to the Compare Bar, and then they could view them all in a table and compare each data point just like on the Tire Decision Guide.

          <p>
            When we converted the Tire Decision Guide results to a tabular format, the increase in conversion rate for users who went through that purchasing path greatly increased. In the first few weeks it was so much higher than the control, on the order of two to three times higher, that we didn&rsquo;t have confidence it was entirely due to the redesign. In the end it did remain higher and proved to be a useful tool for those who needed it.
